                    <h1 class="nHeader">OVERWATCH</h1>
                    <p>Overwatch, what seemed to be a banging success for Activision/Blizzard back in 2016 has recently achieved the famed "Game On!" dead status, with such a promising and refreshing format, Overwatch was seen to be the "new take" on FPS games as a whole, this however ended up very poorly as Activision/Blizzard cannot make a good game for the life of them. The golden days of battle.net are over. The reputation of Activision/Blizzard is dying, and less and less people want to actually play overwatch. I can find a game of diabotical during peak time (around 5pm mountain time as the entire player base has work and it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to find a game before 5pm) quicker than I can find a queue for dps in Overwatch. This game has fallen so far that even the Overwatch Pro Leauge which Activision/Blizzard has pumped millions into is already completely dead and never coming back. The gamers do however have hope for what's coming next in the overwatch world as overwatch 2 is currently in production.</p>

                    <h1 class="nHeader">DIABOTICAL</h1>
                    <p>Diabotical, a new game has already died. With the short lifespan of 1 year, the game already has what appears to be less than a couple hundred players on north american servers. This game was supossed to be the revival of the famed Arena FPS genre, but it seems as though this genre has no hope. Or does it? "Game On!" researchers believe all that is required to kick start the growth of this game again is another boom of popularity similar to the boom of popularity when the game was first released. The player base had a lot of hope and all hope was lost as time went on and new players were not picking up the game, many critisize the genre as being "too difficult" to pick up and learn, as a new player myself, I do agree with this sentiment. The game however is great for players who want to improve their FPS mechanics. The mediocre aimers in diabotical rival pro aim in games such as overwatch.</p>

                    <h1 class="nHeader">BLOONS TOWER DEFENSE 6</h1>
                    <p>Who knew that a childrens game would be more fun to play than overwatch. Thank god I quit playing that game. It is actually so bad I can't believe people still play it. I hope that overwatch 2 isn't going to be a complete disapointment but to be honest from the performance that Activision/Blizzard has been putting on so far, I'm more excited for the upcoming Bloons Tower Defense Battles 2 that is coming out soon. Ninja Kiwi has proven time and time again that a simple web browser based game from our childhood can truly be brought back as an actual game that is fun to play. Aside from the microtransactions that plague the game, the game is genuinely more fun than a lot games nowadays, and the gaming industry truly should be ashamed. It's basically just surprising to me that an indie game company releases better content and more bang for your buck than other triple A companies. Wow. </p>

                    <h1 class="nHeader">CRAB GAME</h1>
                    <p>Speaking of indie game companies making good games, in comes Crab Game. Based on the recent Korean tv show "Squid Game" Crab Game copies the overall format of gameplay from the life or death trials that the characters of "Squid Game" choose to go through for a prize of that sweet sweet cash. Developed on the Unity game engine by A SINGLE PERSON, crab game blows me away with it's fun gameplay and new game modes added in addition to the famed gamemodes shown in Squid Game. The developer of Crab Game known by his online community as "Dani" has made a few games before, namely Muck, a huge success of a multiplayer coop game where you traverse a procedurally generated island filled with monsters and loot with the main goal of fighting bosses and leaving the island and fighting the final boss, a boat. The final boss (boat) is the true final boss as it is basically the most annoying thing to grab all the resources to rebuild this boat. And by that point, the actual final boss is just a two hit kill because of how OP you have become.</p>
